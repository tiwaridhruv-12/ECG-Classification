## Introduction

ECG signals are critical for diagnosing various heart conditions. This project builds a classification model to analyze ECG data and predict cardiac anomalies.  
The solution is designed to be robust and interpretable, targeting both medical researchers and AI enthusiasts.  

## Features

\- Preprocessing and normalization of ECG data.  
\- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
\- Deep learning-based classification using TensorFlow and Keras.  
\- Model evaluation using scikit-learn metrics.  
\- Visualizations of results and model performance.  

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:  
<br/>1\. Clone the repository:  
git clone
<https://github.com/Ayush-yadav11/ECG-Classification.git>  
<br/><br/>2\. Create a virtual environment:  
python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate # On Windows: env\\Scripts\\activate  
<br/>3\. Install the required dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
<br/>

## Usage

1\. Add your ECG dataset in the \`data/\` directory.

2\. Run the preprocessing script:  
python preprocess.py

3\. Train the model:  
python train.py  
<br/>4\. Evaluate the model:  
python evaluate.py  
<br/>5\. View results and visualizations:  
\- Accuracy and loss curves.  
\- Confusion matrix for classification performance.  

## Technologies Used

\- TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.  
\- scikit-learn: For metrics and evaluation.  
\- NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation.  
\- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.  

## Dataset

The project requires ECG signal data in a tabular or time-series format. The data set used is :-  
<br/>\- MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset  
<br/>

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying ECG signals. Below are some highlights of it:  
<br/>\- Training accuracy: 70.43%  
\- Validation accuracy: 65.63%  
\- Confusion matrix and ROC curves are available for analysis in the \`results/\` folder.
